# Installing Lisk (from Binaries)

This tutorial describes how to install the Lisk using pre-built binary packages. It is built under the assumption you are deploying Lisk for the main network.

## 1. Prepare your System

The following operating systems and architectures are supported:

- Linux (x86_64)
- Linux (i686)
- Linux (armv6l)
- Linux (armv7l)
- Darwin (x86_64)
- FreeBSD (amd64)

To complete the installation there are prerequisites that need to be completed. You can find them below if you have not already performed them.

* [Preparing your system for Lisk](https://lisk.io/documentation?i=lisk-docs/PrereqSetup)

**NOTE:** With the release of **0.2.1**, PostgreSQL no longer needs to be installed separately. If you have installed it as part of a previous Lisk release, please review the upgrade guide before continuing.

* [Preparing your system for upgrade](https://lisk.io/documentation?i=lisk-docs/UpgradeSteps)

## 2. Download Lisk

Follow the download instructions to install Lisk for your selected platform. 

### All Platforms

1. Login to the user you will use to run Lisk. This user was created in the [prerequisites setup guide.](https://lisk.io/documentation?i=lisk-docs/PrereqSetup) If you are already logged in to this user, please skip this step.

  ```text
  su - lisk
  ```

2. Download the install script.

  ```text
  wget https://downloads.lisk.io/lisk/main/installLisk.sh
  ```

3. Execute the install script. This will download and install Lisk, configuring the environment for use.

  **Mainnet**
  ```text
  bash installLisk.sh install -r main
  ```   
  
   You will be prompted for your installation directory, pressing enter will choose the default.

   Once it the install is complete change directory to the new install directory.
   
  ```text
  cd lisk-main
  ```

  **Testnet**
  ```text
  bash installLisk.sh install -r test
  ```   
  
   You will be prompted for your installation directory, pressing enter will choose the default.

   Once it the install is complete change directory to the new install directory.
   
  ```text
  cd lisk-test
  ```
  
4. Configure environment _(optional, for apps development)_:

  ```text
  source env.sh
  ```

  Add this to your `.bash_profile` to make this change permanent:

  ```text
  echo "source $(pwd)/env.sh" >> ~/.bash_profile
  ```

5. Accessing Lisk

  To access the Lisk web client, open a browser and navigate to one of the following depending on the network:

  **Mainnet**
  ```text
   http://localhost:8000/
   ```
   **Testnet**
   ```text
   http://localhost:7000/
   ```
   
   Replace **localhost** with your public IP address if you are not running Lisk on your local machine.

  The Lisk web client should launch successfully.
 
6. Proceed with the next step in this tutorial to [Enable Forging](#3-enable-forging).

## 3. Enable Forging

If you are running your node from a local machine, you can enable forging through the web client, without further interruption. **NOTE:** Should the Lisk node or machine need to be restarted, you will need to re-enable forging again.

If your node is running on a remote machine, or if you want to keep forging persistently enabled, you will need to follow the below instructions.

Stop the running Lisk node:

```text
bash lisk.sh stop
```

Open config.json:

```text
nano config.json
```

Arrow down until you find the following section:

```text
"forging": {
  "secret" : [""]
}
```

Set the secret parameter to your account secret phrase.

```text
"forging": {
  "secret" : ["YourDelegatePassphrase"] <- Replace with your delegate passphrase
}
```

(Optional) In the forging section you will also see an access property, this is used to allow only your IP address to enable forging through the web client.

```text
"access": {
  "whiteList": ["127.0.0.1"] <- Replace with the IP which you will use to access your node
}
```

To set 2 accounts to forge on a single node, enter both account passphrases like below.

```text
"forging": {
  "secret" : ["YourDelegatePassphrase1","YourDelegatePassphrase2"] <- Replace with your delegate passphrases
  "access": {
    "whiteList": ["127.0.0.1"]
  }
}
```

After you have typed in your passphrase. Hit: `Ctrl+ X` Then: `Y`

Start Lisk:

```text
bash lisk.sh start
```

Then, open the Lisk web client and wait for the blockchain to load. Once the blockchain has loaded, navigate to "Forging" section, and verify that **Forging (Enabled)** appears in the top left corner.

## 4. Enable Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)

**NOTE:** To complete this step you require a signed certificate (from a CA) and a public and private key pair.

Stop the running Lisk node:

```text
bash lisk.sh stop
```

Open config.json:

```text
nano config.json
```

Arrow down until you find the following section:

```text
"ssl": {
  "enabled": false,         < Change FROM false TO true
  "options": {
    "port": 443,            < Default SSL Port
    "address": "0.0.0.0",   < Change only if you wish to block web access to the node
    "key": "path_to_key",   < Replace FROM path_to_key TO actual path to key file
    "cert": "path_to_cert"  < Replace FROM path_to_cert TO actual path to certificate file
  }
}
```

After you are done, save changes and exit. Hit: `Ctrl+ X` Then: `Y`

**NOTE:** If SSL Port configured above (ssl > options > port) is within well known ports range (below 1024), you must alter the port specified with setcap or change it to be outside of that range.

```text
sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep bin/node
```

Once this is done, or the port specified is above 1024, you may start Lisk

```text
bash lisk.sh start
```

Open the web client. You should now have an SSL enabled connection.

## 5. Available Commands

Listed below, are the available commands which can be used to manage your Lisk node.

To perform a coldstart (only needs to be performed once):

```text
bash lisk.sh coldstart
```

To stop/restart/start lisk:

```text
bash lisk.sh stop
bash lisk.sh start
bash lisk.sh restart
```

To reload config.json changes:

```text
bash lisk.sh reload
```

To check the status of lisk:

```text
bash lisk.sh status
```

To monitor the log file of lisk:

```text
bash lisk.sh logs
```

To replace the blockchain with a new snapshot:

```text
bash lisk.sh rebuild
```

## 6. Troubleshooting

**X Failed to create Postgresql user.**

There may be a problem with your locale settings. Please take a look at our [system preparation guide](https://lisk.io/documentation?i=lisk-docs/PrereqSetup).

If it doesn't solve the problem, do the following:

 ```text		
 -export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8  
 -export LANG=en_US.UTF-8  
 -export LANGUAGE=en_US.UTF-8  
 ```
